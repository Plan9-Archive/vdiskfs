Future Work</A>
</H1>

<P>
While we have shown promising efficiency improvements, it is clear that the
current Venti performance in this environment is far below what would be
desirable.
Venti was primarily developed as a backup archive server, and as such its
implementation is single threaded and not constructed to scale under
heavy load.
Additionally, its performance is primarily bottlenecked by the requirement
of indirecting block requests via the index which results in random access
by the nature of the hash algorithm&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node6.html#memventi">7</A>].
In our future work we plan to address these issues by reworking the Venti
implementation to support multi-threading, more aggressive caching, and
zero-copy of block data.
The use of flash storage for the index may further diminish the additional
latency inherent in the random-access seek behavior of the hash lookup.

<P>
Our target environment will consist of a cluster of collaborating 
Venti servers which provide the backing store for a 
larger cluster of servers acting as hosts for virtual machines.  
In addition to our core Venti server optimizations, we wish to employ
copy-on-read local disk caches on the virtual machine hosts to hide 
remaining latency from the guests.
We also plan on investigating the use of collaborative caching environments
which will allow these hosts and perhaps even the guests to share each other's 
cache resources.

<P>
Another pressing area of future work is to add write support to vdiskfs to
allow end-users to interact with it in a much more natural manner.
We plan on employing a transient copy-on-write layer which will buffer
writes to the underlying disk.  
This write buffer will routinely be flushed to Venti and the vdisk score
updated.
Venti already maintains a history of snapshot scores through links in the 
VtRoot structure, so historical versions of the image can be accessed at later
times.
We would also like to provide a synthetic file hierarchy to access snapshots
in much the same way as implemented by Plan 9's yesterday command.

<P>
Linux recently added a series of system calls to allow user space applications 
to directly manipulate kernel buffers known as splice.  
The splice system call could be used by a 9P file server to move data 
directly from the host page cache, into a kernel buffer, and then allow 
the actual client application (such as QEMU's block-9P back end) to copy the 
data directly from the kernel buffer into its memory.  
In this way, we can avoid the additional copy to and from the TCP socket buffer.

<P>
Another area to explore is to look at integrating the content addressable
storage system with an underlying file system to see if we can obtain 
efficiency closer to that of what we measured using our file-system crawling
mechanism.
We could use our paravirtualized 9P implementation to allow direct access
to the file system from the guests instead of using virtual block devices.
This would eliminate some of the extra overhead, and may provide a better
basis for cooperative page caches between virtual machines.
It also provides a more meaningful way for a user to interact with the 
guest's file system contents than virtual images provide.

<P>
While the large performance gap represents a particularly difficult challenge, 
we believe that the efficiency promise of content addressable storage for 
large scale virtual machine environments more than adequately justifies 
additional investment and investigation in this area.

<P>
