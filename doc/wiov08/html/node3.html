Implementation</A>
</H1>

<P>
In order to get a better idea of the performance and efficiency implications 
of using a CAS based image management system, we constructed a prototype by
combining the Venti&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node6.html#venti">10</A>] CAS back end with a service-oriented file 
system to provide an organizational infrastructure and tested it with 
guest logical partitions running under QEMU&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node6.html#qemu">2</A>] which provides the
Virtual I/O infrastructure for KVM&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node6.html#kvm">6</A>]. 

<P>
Venti provides virtualized storage which is addressed via SHA-1 hashes.
It accepts blocks from 512 bytes to 56kb, using hash trees of blocks to
represent larger entries (VtEntry), and optionally organizing these entries in 
hash trees of hierarchical directories (VtDir), which are collected into
snapshots represented by a VtRoot structure.
Each block, VtEntry, VtDir, and VtRoot has an associated hash value, which 
is also referred to as a score.  
Venti maintains an index which maps these scores to physical disk blocks
which typically contain compressed versions of the data they represent.
Since the SHA-1 hash function effectively summarizes the contents of the
block, duplicate blocks will resolve to the same hash index - allowing 
Venti to coalesce duplicate data to the same blocks on physical storage.

<P>
Using Venti to store partition images is as simple as treating the partition
as a large VtEntry.
Slightly more intelligent storage of file system data (to match native block
sizes and avoid scanning empty blocks) can be done with only rudimentary 
knowledge of the underlying file system.
If the file system isn't recognized, the system can fall-back to a default
block size of 4k.
This approach is used by the vbackup utility in 
Plan 9 from User Space&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node6.html#plan9ports">3</A>] which can be used to provide 
temporal snapshots of 
typical UNIX file systems, and is also used by Foundation&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node6.html#foundation">12</A>]
which provides archival snapshots of VMware disk images.
Multi-partition disks can be represented as a simple one level directory 
with a single VtEntry per partition.  

<P>
Venti only presents an interface to retrieving data by scores and doesn't
provide any other visible organizational structure.  
To address this, we built vdiskfs, a stackable synthetic file server which 
provides support for storing and retrieving disk images in Venti.
Currently, it is a simple pass-through file server that recognizes special
files ending in a ``.vdisk'' extension. 
In the underlying file system a ``.vdisk'' file contains the SHA-1 hash that 
represents a Venti disk image snapshot.  
When accessed via vdiskfs, reads of the file will expose a virtual raw image
file.
vdiskfs is built as a user-space file system using the 9P protocol which can
be mounted by the Linux v9fs&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node6.html#graverobber">5</A>] kernel module or accessed 
directly by applications.

<P>
QEMU internally implements an abstraction for block device level I/O through 
the BlockDriverState API.  
We implemented a new block device that connects directly to a 9P file server.  
The user simply provides the host information of the 9P
file server along with a path within the server and QEMU will connect to 
the server, obtain the size of the specified file, and direct all read/write 
requests to the file server.

<P>
In communicating directly to the 9P file server, QEMU can avoid extraneous data
copying that would occur by first mounting the file system in the host with a
synthetic file system.  It also avoids double-caching the data in the host's
page cache.  Consider a scenario where there were two guests both sharing the
same underlying data block.  This block will already exist once in the host's
page cache when Venti reads it for the first time.  If a v9fs mount was created
that exposed multiple images that contained this block, whenever a user space
process (like QEMU) read these images, a new page cache entry would be added for
each image.

<P>
While QEMU can interact directly with the 9P file server, there is a great 
deal of utility in having a user-level file system mount of the synthetic 
file system.  
Virtualization software that is not aware of 9P can open these images directly 
paying an additional memory/performance cost.  
A user can potentially import and export images easily using traditional 
file system management utilities (like cp).  

<P>
We used QEMU/KVM as the virtual machine monitor in our implementation.  
QEMU is a system emulator that can take advantage of the Linux Kernel Virtual 
Machine (KVM) interface to achieve near-native performance.  
All I/O in QEMU is implemented in user space which makes it particularly well 
suited for investigating I/O performance.

<P>
QEMU/KVM supports paravirtual I/O with the VirtIO&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node6.html#virtio">13</A>] framework.  
VirtIO is a simple ring-queue based abstraction that minimizes the number of 
transitions between the host and guest kernel.  
For the purposes of this paper, we limited our analysis to the emulated 
IDE adapter within QEMU/KVM.  
VirtIO currently only achieves better performance for block I/O in 
circumstances where it can issue many outstanding requests at a time.  
The current vdiskfs prototype can only process a single request at a time.  
Moreover, QEMU is also limited in its implementation to only support a 
single outstanding request at a time.
