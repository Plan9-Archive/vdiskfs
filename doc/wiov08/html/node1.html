Motivation</A>
</H1>

<P>
The installation, organization, and management of disk images is a critical
component of modern virtualization technologies. 
In typical configurations, it is the disk images (and in particular the root
disk image) that defines the identity of a particular virtual machine
instance.
To be effective, a storage virtualization system must be extensible,
able to scale to a large number of virtual machine instances, and support
advanced storage features such as replication, snapshoting, and migration.
It is also highly desirable that such a system be able to rapidly clone
disk images, such that multiple virtual machines may use it as a template
for their own image.

<P>
The introduction of cloud computing magnifies the importance
of scalability and efficiency in dealing with storage virtualization.
Instead of dozens of virtual machines, cloud environments are designed
to support thousands (if not hundreds of thousands&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node6.html#kittyhawk">1</A>]) of 
virtual machines and so will require many-thousand virtual disk images
in order to function - as well as sufficient infrastructure to provide
backups and management.

<P>
Today's virtualization environments have a variety of mechanisms to 
provide disk images.
Users may use raw hardware partitions physically located on the host's
disks, partitions provided by an Operating System's logical volume 
manager&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node6.html#lvm">4</A>], or partitions accessed via a storage area network.
In addition to these raw partitions, many hypervisors provide copy-on-write
mechanisms which allow base images to be used as read-only templates for 
multiple logical instances which store per-instance modifications.

<P>
We have previously experimented with both file and block-based copy-on-write
technologies&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node6.html#blutopia">9</A>] for managing the life cycle of servers.
While we found such ``stackable'' technologies to be very effective for
initial installation, the per-instance copy-on-write layers tended to drift.
For example, over the lifetime of the Fedora 7 Linux distribution there 
were over 500MB of software updates to the base installation of 1.8GB.  
While that
represents only about 27% of changes over a year of deployment - it becomes
greatly magnified in a large-scale virtualization environment.  

<P>
Our assessment at the time was that simple stacking wasn't sufficient,
and that a content addressable storage (CAS) approach to coalescing 
duplicate data between multiple disk images would provide a solution to 
the incremental drift of virtual disks.  
Additionally, the nature of CAS would obviate the
need for end-users to start with a template image as any duplication would
be identified and addressed by the CAS back end.
Furthermore, CAS solutions lend themselves to rapid cloning, snapshoting,
and can be configured to implicitly provide temporal-based backups of images.

<P>
Others have looked at using CAS solutions for archival of virtual machine
images&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node6.html#foundation">12</A>] and managing disk images&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node6.html#mirage">11</A>].  
Nath, et.al. evaluate the use and design tradeoffs of CAS
in managing a large set of VM-based systems in an enterprise 
environment&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node6.html#nath">8</A>].
In all of these cases, the authors used content addressable storage as a 
sort of library from which disk images could be ``checked-out''.  
We were more interested in looking at a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">live</SPAN> solution where the 
disk image was always directly backed by content addressable storage such 
that no check-in or check-out transactions are necessary. 

<P>
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: section 2 provides the results
of our preliminary analysis comparing the amount of duplication present in
several loosely related disk images.
Section 3 describes our prototype implementation of a content addressable
image management system for virtual machines.
Section 4 gives our preliminary performance analysis of the prototype,
and section 5 describes our status and future work.
