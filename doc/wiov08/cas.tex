% Choose the appropriate option:
%
% 1. workingdraft:
%
%       For initial submission and shepherding.  Features prominent
%       date, notice of draft status, page numbers, and annotation
%       facilities.  The three supported annotation macros are:
%               \edannote{text}         -- anonymous annotation note
%               \begin{ednote}{who}     -- annotation note attributed
%                 text                          to ``who''
%               \end{ednote}
%               \HERE                   -- a marker that can be left
%                                               in the text and easily
%                                               searched for later
% 2. proof:
%
%         A galley proof identical to the final copy except for page
%         numbering and proof date on the bottom.  Annotations are
%         removed.
%
% 3. webversion:
%
%       A web-publishable version, uses \docstatus{} to indicate
%       publication information (where and when paper was published),
%       and page numbers.
%
% 4. finalversion:
%
%       The final camera-ready-copy (CRC) version of the paper.
%       Published in conference proceedings.  This doesn't include
%       page numbers, annotations, or draft status (Usenix adds
%       headers, footers, and page numbers onto the CRC).
%
% If several are used, the last one in this list wins
%

%
% In addition, the option "endnotes" permits the use of the
% otherwise-disabled, Usenix-deprecated footnote{} command in
% documents.  In this case, be sure to include a
% \makeendnotes command at the end of your document or
% the endnotes will not actually appear.
%

% These packages are optional, but useful
\usepackage{epsfig}     % postscript figures
\usepackage{url}        % \url{} command with good linebreaks

% Revision History:
% designed specifically to meet requirements of
%  TCL97 committee.
% originally a template for producing IEEE-format articles using LaTeX.
%   written by Matthew Ward, CS Department, Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
% adapted by David Beazley for his excellent SWIG paper in Proceedings,
%   Tcl 96
% turned into a smartass generic template by De Clarke, with thanks to
%   both the above pioneers
% use at your own risk.  Complaints to /dev/null.
% make it two column with no page numbering, default is 10 point

% Munged by Fred Douglis <douglis@research.att.com> 10/97 to separate
% the .sty file from the LaTeX source template, so that people can
% more easily include the .sty file into an existing document.  Also
% changed to more closely follow the style guidelines as represented
% by the Word sample file.
% This version uses the latex2e styles, not the very ancient 2.09 stuff.
%

% Revised July--October 2002 by Bart Massey, Chuck Cranor, Erez
% Zadok and the FREENIX Track folks to ``be easier to use and work
% better''. Hah.  Major changes include transformation into a
% latex2e class file, better support for drafts, and some
% layout improvements.
