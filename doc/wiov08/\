\section{Motivation}

The installation, organization, and management of disk images is a critical
component of modern virtualization technologies. 
In typical configurations, it is the disk images (and in particular the root
disk image) that defines the identity of a particular virtual machine
instance.
To be effective, a storage virtualization system must be extensible,
able to scale to a large number of virtual machine instances, and support
advanced storage features such as replication, snapshoting, and migration.

Boilerplate paragraph on virtualization storage.

Boilerplate paragraph on cloud computing

Backgorund on image management either being raw partitions or image files.

Background on copy-on-write image management.

Review of stackable file system experiences. ~\cite{blutopia}

Discuss our conclusion from the Blutopia work which discussed
the use of content addressable storage to deal with problems of
stackable storage (namely drift).

The rest of this paper is organized as follows, section 2 discusses our
analysis of several Linux images based on different versions of different
distributions on two different architectures.  
Section 3 describes our prototype implementation of a content addressable
image management system for virtual machines.
Section 4 gives our preliminary performance analysis of the prototype,
and section 5 describes our future work.
